>This article discusses how one of the most important Wikipedia
policies, the “neutral point of view” (NPOV), is appropriated and
interpreted by the participants in the Wikipedia project. By analyzing a set of constitutive documents for the Wikipedian universe, including discussion about NPOV, the authors conclude that
ambiguity is at the heart of the policy process on Wikipedia. The
overarching conclusion is that ambiguity on Wikipedia is not extraneous, but a central ingredient of this wiki project’s policymaking.
Ambiguity naturally develops from the pluralist and nonhierarchic values of the culture that brought Wikipedia to life, and this
conclusion requires that we reconsider the nature of “neutrality”
practiced on Wikipedia.

We are particularly interested in understanding how conflict and ambiguity influence the manner in which active Wikipedia members understand the making and implementation of the “neutral point of view” (NPOV) policy.1

#main-argument
> In what follows, we argue that NPOV, one of Wikipedia’s core policies, is affected by subjective interpretation and constant conflicts. At the same time, we propose that conflict is alleviated, if not completely reduced, by allowing systemic ambiguity. Our main claim is that the Wikipedian project is successful only insofar as it has learned to solve meaning-related conflict through ambiguity

> Ours is a preliminary essay whose goal is to determine the conceptual validity of the proposition that the implementation of one of Wikipedia’s core policies is fundamentally ambiguous. Its ambitions are theoretical and interpretive, not exhaustively descriptive.
