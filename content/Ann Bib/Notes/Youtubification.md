## Abstract
- Youtube political videos are in top 3
- to what degree to those vidoes influent perceptions
- to what degree does the source of the video make an impact
- ethos is most appealing, then logos, then pathos
- no relationship found in the efficacy, or the political cynicism
- 2000 & 2004 bereakout years for social media political activism (734)
## Theoretical Background
talks alot about the origin, the large amount of users, and major instances where it was a major player in a political situation
## Credibility Research
#aristotelian
it discusses the characteristics listed below

Decades  of  credibility  research  tend  to  agree  that  a  message’s  power  to  persuade  is influenced by three categories of factors: the characteristics of the source (ethos), of the message (logos and pathos), and of the audience. (735)

Selnow (1998) argues that channels are not neutral conduits but rather that they endow messages with certain qualities. When audiences can actually see the source (e.g., video), rather than experience a more highly mediated recounting of the message (e.g., print or Internet text), that message receiver puts more strength in his or her judgments. (736)

Format is said to influence the reception of messages. For instance, Petty, Wells, and Brock (1976) found that logical arguments benefited from simple and uncluttered presentation (736)
### Credibility of Online Political Information Sources

### Credibility and Political Attitude
talks about [[political efficacy]]
Bimber (1998) and  Johnson  and  Kaye  (1998)  establish  that  the  Internet  allows  access  to  political information, allowing more participation and informed citizens, potentially leading to a  greater  influence  on  the  political  process. (738)

 Web users tend to be more politically know-ledgeable than the average citizen. Netizens also tend to score higher on measures for political interest and engagement, are more likely to vote, and are more likely to seek out political information (Johnson & Kaye, 2000). (738)

## Research Questions and Hypotheses
This study is exploratory, not definitive

> *Research Question 1*: Which credibility factors (ethos, logos or pathos) influence the viewers’ perception of online political videos?
> *Research Question 2*: Do political attitudes such as political efficacy and political cynicism affect perceptions of online political videos?
> (738)

## Method
Three organic (e.g., already existing on YouTube) videos were selected as stimuli. To ensure consistency among the stimuli and maintain as much control of the content as possible, the researchers selected videos all dealing with same issue (health care). Each video approached the issue from a different perspective, which was based on Aristotle’s persuasive appeals of ethos, logos, and pathos. Videos were all similar in length, each being approximately 3 min long
(739)
all videos had under 500 views
233 participants
about 75% female, average age of 22, 93% registered to vote, 87% planned to vote

## Discussion
> One  of  the  more  interesting  findings  that  came  out  of  this  study  deals  with  how participants perceived the health care video that used the humor appeal. Even with the large number of viewers who watch humor-related shows, the information is not seen as credible as that coming from an expert or from a fact-based argument. This finding could  be  attributable  to  various  reasons,  including  the  perception  of  humor  among participants and the credibility of the citizen featured in the video. For example, the findings  might  have  been  different  if  it  were  John  Stewart  or  Steven  Colbert  as  the “host” of the video rather than just an everyday man (744)

> who designated themselves as liberal were more likely to highly rate the logos and pathos appeals than conservatives
> (745)

By that logic, the republicans just hear it from someone and trust that

## Conclusion
As  new  forms  of  political  information  develop,  understanding  of  citizens’  use  and perception of the technology will help campaigns better serve voters. Viral videos are more than just a hot topic or a forward from all of one’s friends; they can be effectively used as forms of online political information produced by citizens for other citizens. This study adds to the research about the perception of appeals used in these videos, especially in regard to citizen-produced material.
