> Previous work has focused on analyzing the user activities or the social interactions in Q&A websites. However, analyzing the actual textual content of these websites can help the software engineering community to better understand the thoughts and needs of developers. In the article, we present a methodology to analyze the textual content of Stack Overflow discussions

>For these reasons, developers often turn to programming question and answer (Q&A) websites, such as Stack Overflow (2012a), to seek help and advice from their peers about the technical challenges they face. Stack Overflow moderates hundreds of thousands of posts each month from developers with a variety of backgrounds, asking questions about a wide range of topics. Taken in aggregate, these posts act as a record of the history of the needs and thoughts of developers—a knowledge repository of programmers’ needs.

> Our methodology is based on latent Dirichlet allocation (Blei et al. 2003; Blei and Lafferty 2009), a statistical topic model used to automatically recover topics (i.e., groups of related words that approximate a real-world concept) from a corpus of text documents. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has been used successfully in many domains and is routinely applied to millions of documents (Hall et al. 2008; Griffiths and Steyvers 2004)

the following is (621-621):
*What are the main discussion topics in Stack Overflow?*
*Does a question in one topic trigger answers in another?
- this helps to identify what common problems one area faces in other
- eg mobile developement and web dev often leading to topics about UI interfaces suggests both face the same issue
How does developer interest change over time?
- helps identify future research opportunity
How do the interests in specif ic technologies change over time?*
- helps with more specific research
- compare impacts of different techs
