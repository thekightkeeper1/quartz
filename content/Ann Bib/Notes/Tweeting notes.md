## Intro

> this study examines whether and how frames may converge among a diverse group of immigrantserving organizations after a suddenly imposed grievance
(6049)
.

trump banned immigration, and many ethnically diverse organizations protested, on twitter and other platforms

> We argue that the travel ban exemplifies a suddenly imposed grievance and moral shock, thus providing the opportunity for explicating the role of Twitter in immigrant NGOs’ strategic framing processes, and furthering our understanding of how, in this social media era, a suddenly imposed grievance might unify nonprofit organizations serving distinct immigrant communities.

# Tweeing as Advocacy Communication
Social media enable rapid information diffusion through decentralized networks (Garrett, 2006), and facilitate efficient coordination among like-minded organizations during collective events. During the Occupy Wall Street movement, for example, activists leveraged Twitter and Facebook to broadcast protest updates, negotiate attention through personalized political messages, and ultimately mobilize various resources toward achieving the movement’s goals


> Existing literature identifies two ways in which social media can be used to achieve advocacy goals. First, Twitter fosters the emergence of an issue community (Bruns & Burgess, 2011), which is critical for the spread of movement ideas and consensus mobilization (Klandermans, 1984).

> The diffusion of movement tactics via networks has long been documented in social movement studies (Harlow, 2013; Soule & Roggeband, 2012; D. J. Wang & Soule, 2012).

>Framing is a key micromobilization process by which social movements “assign meaning to and interpret relevant events and conditions in ways that are intended to mobilize potential adherents and constituents, to garner bystander support, and to demobilize antagonists”

^ Basically, framing is when something like the immigration ban happens, and then someone on SO talks about it. Their process of trying to persuade people that SO should support the anti-ban and how the ban goes against the solidarity as programmers that SO should have is all just that person "framing"

> In other words, a social movement’s ability to legitimize its actions, create a sense of collective identity, and inspire support depends on its framing techniques, or its ability to depict its goals and characterize its messages in a way that resonates with the public

- diagnostic framing - stating a prob
	- e.g. highlighing injustice against US aliens and blaming trump
- prognostic framing - proposing a solution
	- often, even movments supporting the same cause, use this framing to distinguish themselves (benford & Snow, 2000)
- motivational framing - call to arms or solidarity

# Diverse Agendas
recognizing that specific ethinic groups dont actually all have the same goal. Although they all support imigrants, not all immigrants are the same. The differences in ethnicities show up in the organizations, which usually only  suppport the goals of the culture they sponsor. There are two, types, though. General Immigrant-serving NGOs, and specialist ones
Due to all of the differences, they experience discrimination differently and should be treated as such. Just think about how gays are lumped in with the idea of a "minority", which could also be an immigrant. And an immigrant could be a 3rd world african immigrant, or hispanic, or middle eastern. And literally none o f those people will be like any other.
