I was thinking about my question. I think I will only find 1 -3 posts on SO. Of those, I then need to categorize into political and meta. Probably, most of them will be meta, but well see. The ones that are political, I then care about whether they are effective, maybe. I think i needd to really just see some posts to figure out if its worth it. But if its worth it to do something with them, then I will care about... i dunno. 
On the meta side, well, I care about ... lets just say that I care about the aristotelian appeal? Do I care about how effective the arguments are? Its not so much that I care either way about the arguments.... I just think that I care about how platforms that are supposed to be nuetral allow politics on to their site. I care more about the rhetoric of the post, and more than the rhetoric, I think I care about content too. Which makes it difficult. Cause like, I dont have the tools, really, to look at content? I dont think that I have enough posts. So, I have to look at the comments aswell, which are meta, discussing what should or shouldnt be allowed. So I can look at what aristotelian elements they have in those comments, and I can find other things to code by, really. I mean I can really just look for any rhetorical technique, and see what they do
