	When the Tenets of Composition Go Public: A Study of Writing in Wikipedia

First introducing Wikipedia, the article then quickly transitions to the describing its exigence, that its potential as a writing resource, especially in scholarly work, is "lost when Wikipedia is treated merely as a flawed textual product." One of the aspect that the article focuses on is that Wikipedia can be unreliable because it the revisions are not limited to gramatical ones, but rather entire ideas can be changed. The author claims that Wikipedia's page revision process, although producing unstable source material, allows the for the best development of scholarly knowledge, as it allows to be highlighed the importance of "messy" writing processes in developing texts.
The author selected 3 topic articles from Wikipedia, and coded every available version of it from 2003 to 2004. He coded them according to the types of changes, such as fixing hyperlinks, or fixing sabotages.
From this the author concluded that it is not accurate to constrain Wikipedia to just the definition of an online encyclopedia. It instead represents "a model of research where the goal is not efficient consumption... but generative production (i.e., contribution to the development of sough information)." The author highlights how typical research does not alter the original, but Wikipedia does. But this is important to the author as it allows new researches in the field to become part of a process of really producing consumable and good text, rather can simply consuming it.
