	Tweeting in Solidarity: Examining Frame Diffusion and Alignment Processes Among
# Summary
The article studied how immigrant serving NGOs hashtag's changed from before former President Trump's immigration ban to after the ban. The results Found that there was a noticable increase in the number of shared hashtags among different ethnic groups. A conclusion the researchers drew was that "[t]he findings about tweets after the ban are particularly noteworthy, as they show that a suddenly imposed grievance like the Muslim ban can catalyze to prompt intergroup solidarity" (6065). There were also significant findings in how the types of "frames" the NGOs used. The article based the idea of a frame from research done by Benford & Snow in 2000, and the idea of a frame is that the frame of a political post is how the speaker "depicts its goals and characterize its messages in a way that resonates with the public" (6052). And so, the research found a shift from frames that isolate NGOs of different ethnicitis, to collective frames that all the NGOs shared.
