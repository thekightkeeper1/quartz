	Wikipedia’s “Neutral Point of View
This article discusses Wikipedia's policy of Neutral Point of View (NPOV) as it is appropriated and discussed by the community. After introducing Wikipedia, and its significance as a powerful tool of public, easily accessible and editable, knowledge, the  article begins to outline it's exigence:  "*understanding how conflict and ambiguity influence the manner in which active Wikipedia members understand the making and implementation of the [NPOV]*" (40). Specifically, it is arguing that Wikipedia's NPOV policy, designed to stop conflict, actually itself creates internal conflict. Throughout the article is the implication that Wikipedia's goal of neutrality is neither achieved nor even possible.

Instead, the arguments they analyze ultimately die off, ending in proposed stances, but no final one. Ultimately, the findings are that *"the conflicts and ambiguity present at the level of interpreting Wikipedia rules are not extraneous, but central ingredients of this wiki project"* (50).
