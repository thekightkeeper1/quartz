	YouTube-ification of Political Talk: An Examination of Persuasion Appeals in Viral Video
# Summary
This study investigates credibility of the political messages disseminated through YouTube. Specifically, it asks the questions:

> *Research Question 1*: Which credibility factors (ethos, logos or pathos) influence the viewersâ€™ perception of online political videos?
> *Research Question 2*: Do political attitudes such as political efficacy and political cynicism affect perceptions of online political videos?
> (738)

After the abstract, it gives the theoretical background of the study. They used a small sample set of 233 participants and 3 videos. Participants were coded into the following categories:
- Political efficacy
- political cynicism
- gender
- ethnicity
- party
Measuring the 3 appeals was done by survey questions on a scale, using Johnson and Kaye's and McCrosky's source credibility optimizations (741)
The results indicated that ethos was the strongest argument of any. Next came logos, and finally the humorous pathos appeal. The political efficacy of the speaker did not correlate to the effectiveness of the argument. The study also noted different trends in genders and political affiliations, where females found the logos argument more appealing to women, and liberals more likely to find logos and/or pathos more appealing compared to conservatives (745). In the conclusion and throughout, the article claims that viral videos are more than just a "hot topic", and that they garner more research as effective channels for political information and arguments.
