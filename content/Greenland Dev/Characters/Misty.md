## Summary
She is a stubborn, single mother, who doesnt need a man. Read headed and with freckles, her green eyes stand out briliantly. But no she's not crying, her eyes are just misty. If you joke about that she will f\*\*k you up, like she did her last (and only) husband. But shes really loyal.  Her occupation is as a [[Faerie Dancing]], and as such is considered quite highly, sub only to the chief.

# Notes
## Why the hecker doodles are eyes misty
Also is misty her actual name or a nick name?
B/c she is half [[Faeries]].
