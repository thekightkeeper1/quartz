## Summary
Blobus, (no full name) is known mainly for sneaking into buildings and masquerading as [[The obscure puddle that sadly nobody sees]]. He really likes to be puddles, but not to be stepped on. Hence why he also goes for the obscure puddles; although he has yet to realize that although nobody steps on him, neither do they see him. Even more tragic is that his evil brother [[Frogus]] has made a rumor go about.
