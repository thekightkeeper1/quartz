# Spoiler Content

## Lore
Immortal beings heralding from before even the beginning of [[Timeline|time]] itself, they are the original form of life. Or at least, so would theories propose. Wars between them they have caused many of the great catastrophe's of the world. The Flooding of the Earth was in fact [[The Great of Bobi]]. After that war, however, the only confirmed surviving member of the species was the mother of the [[Bobus Twins]]. 

## Discovering
[[The obscure puddle that sadly nobody sees]] and [[the annoy puddle everyone slips on]] are both present throughout the entire beginning of the game, however, the player is unable to interact with them until going [[Overworld]] and discovering the religion surrounding [[Norris]]. After talking to the group that worships Norris and meeting them, the player is simply able to interact with a puddle.


## Drinking a Bobus
Drinking a good Bobus causes you to reach the 4th level of Enlightenment, Arahant. Their complete lack of self strips even the drinker's self temporarily. The drinker loses all attachment to the world, and also loses ignorance, immediately understanding and knowing everything. It is also a mild toxin that inhibits memory formation and motor control. Typically, this results in the drinker only speaking gibberish, and having no memory of Enlightenment. Also, Bobi don't like to be drunk. Historically (like really historically, I'm talking about the sentient societies before modern man) drinking a Bobus does not turn out well for you
